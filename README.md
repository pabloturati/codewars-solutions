# CodeWars

This is the GitHub repository where I save copies of the katas I've completed on codewars.com.

## About

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as Kata. These discrete programming exercises train a variety of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online Integrated development environment.[source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codewars)
